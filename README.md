# Quicksort
Quicksort Implementation based on the book: INtroduction to Algorithms (Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, Clifford Stein)

The quicksort algorithm has a worst-case running time of O(n<sup>2</sup>) on an input array of n numbers. 
Despite this slow worst-case running time, quicksort is often the best practical choice for sorting because it is remarkable efficient on the average: its expected running time is O(nlog(n)), and the constant factors hidden in the notation are quite small. 
It also has the advantage of sorting in place.
Runs best when all elements are distinct.
